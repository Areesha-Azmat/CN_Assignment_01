QUIC Analysis – CN Assignment 01
Q1. What is the name of website?
The website is identified from the SNI (Server Name Indication) in the TLS ClientHello embedded in QUIC.
Website: www.litespeedtech.com

Q2. Find the packet that contains the Initial QUIC handshake. What information is exchanged here?
Packet: 58
Type: Initial QUIC packet
Information exchanged:
TLS ClientHello
Proposed cipher suites (3 suites offered)
Key share values: X25519MLKEM768, x25519, secp256r1
Supported version: TLS 1.3
QUIC transport parameters
Connection IDs (DCID, SCID)
////////////////////////////
The Initial QUIC handshake is seen in the first client → server QUIC Initial packet.
Information exchanged includes:
QUIC version proposed
Destination & Source Connection IDs
Embedded TLS ClientHello (with SNI, cipher suites, supported groups, ALPN = h3)



Q3. Identify the QUIC packet that contains the TLS ClientHello.
The TLS ClientHello is embedded inside the Initial QUIC packet:

Packet: 58
Path: QUIC → CRYPTO → TLSv1.3 Handshake → Client Hello
Q4. Which QUIC version is used in your trace?
From the QUIC header in Packet 58:
Version: 1 (0x00000001) → IETF QUIC v1 (used for HTTP/3)
/////////////////
The TLS ClientHello is carried inside the first QUIC Initial packet from client → server.
It contains:
SNI = www.litespeedtech.com
Supported cipher suites (TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, etc.)
Supported groups (X25519, secp256r1)
Supported versions (TLS 1.3 only)
Key share (X25519)
ALPN extension (h3)


Q5. Locate the packet where 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys are first used.
The first QUIC 1-RTT Protected packet marks the start of encrypted communication.
This packet indicates the use of 1-RTT keys for secure application data transfer.
////////////
Since this is a fresh connection (no resumption), only 1-RTT keys are used.
The first 1-RTT Protected Packet from client → server marks the use of 1-RTT keys for encryption.

Q6. Find the first packet that carries application data (HTTP/3). How does this differ from HTTP over TCP?
The first 1-RTT Protected packet with Stream Frame carries the HTTP/3 application data.
Differences from HTTP over TCP:

QUIC runs on UDP instead of TCP.
TLS 1.3 encryption is built directly into QUIC.
Multiplexing streams avoids head-of-line blocking.
Faster connection setup is possible (0-RTT / 1-RTT).
//////////////////////
The first HTTP/3 application data is seen inside a QUIC 1-RTT packet, with frame type = HTTP/3 HEADERS/DATA.

Difference from HTTP over TCP:

HTTP/3 is built on QUIC (UDP), not TCP.
QUIC integrates TLS 1.3 directly, no separate TLS handshake.
Faster connection setup (1 RTT vs 3 RTT for TCP+TLS).
QUIC avoids TCP’s head-of-line blocking by handling streams independently.
