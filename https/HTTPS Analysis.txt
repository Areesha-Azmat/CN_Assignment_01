HTTPS Analysis
Q7. What is the name of website?
The website is identified from the SNI. 
Website:example.com

Q8. Find the packet that contains the ClientHello message.
The ClientHello is found in Packet No. 25 with SNI = example.com.

Q9. List all the TLS extensions included in the ClientHello.
The ClientHello included the following TLS extensions:

server_name (SNI = example.com)
extended_master_secret
renegotiation_info
supported_groups
ec_point_formats
session_ticket
application_layer_protocol_negotiation (ALPN)
status_request
supported_versions (TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2)
signature_algorithms
key_share (X25519)
psk_key_exchange_modes

Q10. Identify the ServerHello message. What cipher suite is chosen by the server?
The ServerHello is visible after the ClientHello.

Cipher Suite chosen: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x1302)
This means the connection uses TLS 1.3 with AES-256-GCM and SHA-384.

Q11. Locate the Certificate message. Extract the server’s certificate information.
From the Certificate [0] packet (server → client):
Issuer: DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1
Subject: CN=www.example.org
 (SAN includes example.com)

Validity:
Not Before: Aug 1, 2024
Not After: Aug 1, 2025

Q12. After the TLS handshake, identify the first encrypted application data packet. Why can’t you directly see the HTTP headers in this packet?
 The first Application Data packet (Content Type = 23) appears immediately after the TLS handshake completes.
This packet contains the encrypted HTTP request.
Reason headers are hidden: All HTTP traffic is encrypted after TLS 1.3 handshake. Without the session keys, Wireshark cannot decrypt or display the HTTP headers.
